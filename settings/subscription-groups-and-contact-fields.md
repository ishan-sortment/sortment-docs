# Subscription Groups And Contact Fields

**Subscription groups** in Sortment allow you to organize your email communications into distinct groups, giving users greater control over the types of emails they receive.

It also empower recipients to manage their email preferences based on interest or intent.

For example, you can create a subscription group specifically for **newsletter emails**. If a user opts out of this group, they’ll stop receiving newsletters but can still receive **order updates**, **promotions**, or other types of emails they're subscribed to.

**Types of Subscription Group**

* **Opt-in**: Users need to manually subscribe to receive messages from the group.
* **Opt-out**: Users are automatically subscribed but have the option to unsubscribe.
* **Required**: Users cannot unsubscribe from the group, often used for essential communications like account updates.

#### **How Subscription Groups Work in Sortment**

* When sending an **email campaign**, you can assign it to a subscription group.
* **Email templates** include **subscription links**—such as _unsubscribe_ and _manage preferences_—allowing users to update their preferences at any time.
* If a recipient has **unsubscribed** from that group, they will be **automatically excluded** from futures campaigns sent in that subscription group.
* You can view and update user’s subscription preferences from their **customer profile**.&#x20;
* If a user is excluded due to their subscription status, the count for subscription related audience exclusion is updated in campaign reports.

#### **How to Bulk Unsubscribe users**

* You can bulk unsubscribe users by selecting "Import Unsubscribers" at a global channel level (separate lists for Email, SMS, Whatsapp), and uploading a CSV formatted as per the CSV file available on screen.
* You can also unsubscribe users at a subscription group level by selecting the 'Unsubscribe users' option in the drop down menu next to the subscription group, and uploading a CSV formatted as per the CSV file available on screen.

### **Category**

A **category** is a broader organizational structure used to group related **subscription groups** together for better management and user experience. Categories allow for a cleaner and more organized presentation of subscription options on the user's preference or unsubscribe page.

**Example**:

A category named "Product Notifications" might contain subscription groups like "Updates", "Release Announcements", and "Bug Fixes".

* A category named "Product Notifications" might contain subscription groups like "Updates", "Release Announcements", and "Bug Fixes".
* A category named "Promotions" could house groups like "Sales", "Holiday Offers", and "New Arrivals".

### **Contact Fields**

Defines the channels and identifiers used to contact a user against that channel (Email, SMS, WhatsApp). Since Sortment operates on your data warehouse, it allows you to have multiple contact fields against same user for a given channel.

#### How to setup contact fields

* Navigate to respective channel tab under Contact Fields in workspace settings.
