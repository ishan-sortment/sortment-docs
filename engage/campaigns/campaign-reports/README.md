### 1. Overview of reports

Once a campaign is sent via Sortment, a post-campaign report is generated automatically. This report provides insight into how the campaign performed across various user engagement stages.

#### Available charts and tables

* **Campaign Summary:** Quick stats such as total sent, opens, clicks, conversions.
* **Click Tracking Table:** detailed breakdown of all links included in the campaign with outputs like total clicks and unique clicks.
* **Audience Exclusion Table:** Shows users excluded from delivery due to global unsubscribes, subscription group preferences, null data validation or frequency capping.
* **Funnel Chart:** A step-by-step drop-off visualization of the campaign (Sent → Delivered → Opened → Clicked → Converted).
* **Performance Over Time:** Time-series analysis of open, click, and conversion events.
* **Aggregated Time Analysis:** Breakdown by hour, day, or week for identifying peak interaction windows.
* **Custom Tracking Events:** If configured, additional user events such as “Product Viewed” or “Added to Cart” are included.

### **3. Report sections explained**

**3.1 Click tracking report**

* A detailed list of all links clicked by users, showing:
  * **Link URL**
  * **Total clicks**: Total times each link was clicked.
  * **Unique clicks**: Number of unique users who clicked the link.
  * Percentages next to each value indicate what fraction of total clicks that link represents.
* **Use case**: Understand user interest by analyzing which content or product links were most engaging.



**3.2 Audience exclusions summary**

This section outlines how many users were excluded from the campaign due to:

* **Global unsubscribes**: Users who opted out of all communications on the channel.
* **Subscription group unsubscribes**: Users opted out of specific categories (e.g., newsletters, promos).
* **Null check failures**: Users dropped due to missing required profile data (send to value like email, phone respectively).
* **Frequency capping exclusions**: Users skipped due to limits on how often they can be contacted.

#### **3.3 Funnel chart**

The funnel chart illustrates user progression through five stages:

* **Sent**: Total emails dispatched.
* **Delivered**: Emails that reached inboxes.
* **Opened**: Emails that were opened.
* **Clicked**: Users who clicked on any links.
* **Converted**: Users who completed a predefined conversion goal (e.g., signup, purchase).

Use the funnel to identify bottlenecks or drop-offs in engagement.

#### **3.4 Performance over time**

Displays how user activity evolves post-send:

* Tracks opens, clicks, and conversions over time.
* Helps analyze time-based responsiveness and campaign shelf-life.

**Note**: If data is missing or seems delayed, verify sync status and ensure campaign filters are correctly applied.
