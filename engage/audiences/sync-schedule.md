# Sync Schedule

Audiences are created and managed on the warehouse. To maintain data freshness, Sortment allows setting up a sync for the audience at regular intervals. You can also trigger a run manually from the audience page.

### Setting Audience Refresh Schedule

From audience manager, click on action menu for any audience and click **Change Run Schedule**.

3. The scheduler has different run options:
   * Generate once now: This will create the audience now and store the static list of the users in the warehouse for your use
   * Generate every: It takes a start time input, frequency of run, and end time input to maintain data freshness in your warehouse.
4. Once saved, the audience run will get scheduled and executed into the warehouse. It could take some time depending on how big the query is and how much computing power is available to Sortment.
5. Once run is successfully completed, the status will be updated in the audience manager for you to use the audience in campaigns.
