   1. **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Sortment
   2. **API Key:** On the SendGrid app, find and click on the Settings tab on the left-hand navigation menu. In the sub-menu, click on "API Keys". Create a new API Key and copy the same. You may also use a previously generated API Key, in case you have it.
   3. **From Email:** In your SendGrid account, from the Settings tab on the left navigation menu, find "Sender Authentication" and copy the details of the Sender that you intend on using. Alternatively, you can add a domain or a single user on SendGrid from the same page.&#x20;
   4. **From Name:** Enter the name associated with the Sender that was entered in the "From Email" field.
   5. **Unsubscribe Group ID**: Enter the group ID associated with your SendGrid account

### Message Delivery Status

1. Log in to your SendGrid account.
2. From the left navigation panel, find **Settings** and navigate to **Mail Settings**.
3. On the page that loads, find **Event Webhooks** and click on the edit icon.
4. On the pop-up that loads, select an **Authentication Method** and enter Sortment's POST URL (This will be shared on request).
5. Select the data you want to be sent by checking on the relevant boxes and save the configuration

### Test your connection

Once the steps detailed above have been completed, you can test your connection to see whether the email is being sent successfully.&#x20;

### Adding Un-subscription groups to all emails sent

Given the latest changes by email providers including Google and Yahoo, adding un-subscription option in each email being sent is a must.&#x20;

Sortment supports you to add the un-subscription group IDs created on SendGrid while sending out emails and any templates.&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
Steps to activate unsub IDs 
1. Ensure you have created unsub ID / unsub group ID in your SendGrid account 
2. Go to Marketing → Unsubscribe groups to see the list of your unsub groups / IDs 
Share the ID that you want to use across all your templates and share with Sortment 
```
{% endcode %}

> For now Sortment only supports 1 unsub ID against all email templates. We will automatically attach the group ID value to your template variable.
